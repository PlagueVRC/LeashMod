# LeashMod
Ever wanted a PROPER leash in VRChat? Here it finally is.

With the combination of a mod and avatar objects, you can have a FULLY dynamic, visible to all and functional leash in VRChat, being pulled back, being able to be yanked by your master (or vice versa), being able to be locked somewhere in the world and much, much more!

Note; this is a invite only mod. The above invite is to the waiting room, at which you can then DM me on discord for an invite. Note there's no 100% guarantee, but it's somewhat likely.
